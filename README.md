# media-speech-webapp
 I have create this project which works on main three things which is Media Player, Youtube Downloading and Speech Synthesis (Text into Speech)
 
 THE POINT IS !!
 
 YOUTUBE DOWNLOADER PART
 On youtube downloader I didn't use any kind of API fetching Data Process, But I just take the Simple way by adding the URL then Another URL for the link that has to be
 downloaded just like that https://serverconverterlink/https://ourdatalinkfromyoutube the we leave the work for the server platform
 
 
MEDIA PLAYER PART
I use a simple way that will not save the playlist after we refresh the site that means. You can add the music at once but then after refreshing the page there will
have not playlist... So there I use Filereader which read data as multiple and then put the in array and display the on the index field. And I gave then many partition 
so that we can work on them from displaying as a playlist, as inline pop-up and Media player tube..

SPEECH SYNTHESIS PART
I use Normal Window.speechSynthesis.Utterance() code which allows me to enable speech for the typed words... and There we get the concept
